# WK2-PORTFOLIO
Natasha Ortiz - Week 2 Portfolio

A portfolio project for future use to upload and maintain project examples to present to employers. 

While I had little challenges with the HTML, the CSS did trip me up - namely the flexbox and media query parts.
Ultimately I got stuck on small things and ran out of time.
I tried my best to do what I could, however this will be an ongoing project I will have to improve immensely and go back to. 

I will use this read me to list some 'To-Do's for this Portfolio.

TO-DO:
>Go back over flex & CSS
>Clean up CSS
>Invest time in looking back into 'media query'
